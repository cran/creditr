\title{Calculates Implied Recovery Rate}
\usage{
implied_RR(x, date.var = "date", tenor.var = "tenor",
  maturity.var = "maturity", spread.var = "spread", pd.var = "pd")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame, contains all the relevant columns.}

\item{date.var}{character, column in x containing date variable.}

\item{tenor.var}{character, column in x containing tenors.}

\item{maturity.var}{character, column in x containing maturity date.}

\item{spread.var}{character, column in x containing spread in basis points.}

\item{pd.var}{name of the column containing the probability of default rates.}
}
\value{
implied recovery rate in percentage based on the general
  approximation for a probability of default in the Bloomberg manual. The
  actual calculation uses a complicated bootstrapping process, so the results
  may be marginally different.
}
\description{
\code{implied_RR} that calculates the recovery rate implied by the CDS spread
and probability of default (pd) by using the ISDA model. This takes a data
frame of inputs and returns a vector of the same length.
