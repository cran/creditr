\usage{
spread_to_pd(x, recovery.var = "recovery", currency.var = "currency",
  tenor.var = "tenor", maturity.var = "maturity", date.var = "date",
  spread.var = "spread")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame, contains all the relevant columns.}

\item{recovery.var}{character, column in x containing recovery rates. ISDA
model standard recovery rate asscumption is 0.4.}

\item{currency.var}{character, column in x containing currency.}

\item{tenor.var}{character, column in x containing tenors.}

\item{maturity.var}{character, column in x containing maturity date.}

\item{date.var}{character, column in x containing date variable.}

\item{spread.var}{character, column in x containing spread in basis points.}
}
\value{
vector containing the probability of default, calculated by using the
  formula for probability of default given in the Bloomberg Manual
}
\description{
