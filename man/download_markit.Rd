\title{Get rates from Markit}
\usage{
download_markit(start, end, currency = "USD")
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{date for gathering interest rates. Must be a Date type}

\item{end}{date for gathering interest rates. Must be a Date type}

\item{currency}{for which rates are being retrieved}
}
\value{
data frame containing the rates from every day from start to end
  dates. Note: the date in the output data frame does not refer to the rates
  of that day but to the date on which the CDS is being priced. So the
  corresponding rate is actually the rate of the previous day. Example: if
  the column reads 2014-04-22, the corresponding rates are actually for
  2014-04-21.
