\title{Build a data frame containing interest rates for CDS pricing}
\usage{
build_rates(start.date, end.date)
}
\arguments{
\item{start.date}{is the start date of the data frame; it is the earliest CDS
pricing date that the user concerns.}

\item{end.date}{is the end date of the data frame; it is the lastest CDS
  pricing date that the user concerns.}
}
\value{
a data frame that contains the CDS pricing date, the currency, the
  interest rate expiry and the interest rate.
}
\description{
\code{build_rates} can create a data frame of interest rates from a start
date to an end date, which are specified by the user. The interest rates will
be later used in CDS pricing. \code{build_rates} also builds the rates.RData
in the package. \code{build_rates} mainly consists \code{download_markit} and
\code{download_FRED}. The two sources are Markit website and FRED website.
}
\details{
since Markit wesite has the interest rates back to th 1990s, download_markit
is responsible for building up all the USD interest rate data frame; for EUR
and JPY, markit can only get from 2005-01-05 to now. But the biggest
advantage of using download_markit is that, since Markit website only lists
the rate expiries that are actually used for CDS pricing, download_markit can
get the exact type of expiries of rates needed to price CDS. Also, it has
expiry over 1Y to 30Y. In contrast, FRED is only complementary to markit
data. Since download_markit can get any rates for USD, we don't use FRED for
USD. Then we want to get data for EUR and JPY before 2005-01-04 (the limit of
markit). FRED has almost all data for any date, which is its biggest
advantage. But its biggest disadvantage is that it doesn't know which expiry
type is suitable for which time, since FRED website has expiry of all types
below a year; also it doesn't have expiry over 1Y.So we hardcoded the dates
below, to combine markit and FRED in the most suitable way.

Another note is that, the rates on both Markit website and FRED website have
not been adjusted to the previous business day. In other words, the rates
from both website is the exact rate on that day, rather than on the previous
business day. But download_markit and download_FRED have adjusted the days
already for the convenience of CDS pricing, so we don't have to worry here.
